Great! Since you’ve completed automation testing, moving to **performance testing** is a smart next step. Here’s a **step-by-step guide to get started with performance testing on your Linux system**, using **Apache JMeter**, one of the most popular tools for this purpose.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Guide for Performance Testing using Apache JMeter (on Linux)

---

### 🔧 Step 1: Install Java (JDK)

JMeter requires Java to run.

1. Open your terminal and check if Java is installed:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

2. If not installed, install OpenJDK:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
   ```

3. Confirm installation:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

---

### 📥 Step 2: Download and Install Apache JMeter

1. Download the latest JMeter binary (you can check the latest version at [https://jmeter.apache.org/download\_jmeter.cgi](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)):

   ```bash
   wget https://downloads.apache.org//jmeter/binaries/apache-jmeter-5.6.3.tgz
   ```

2. Extract it:

   ```bash
   tar -xvzf apache-jmeter-5.6.3.tgz
   ```

3. Move it to a suitable location:

   ```bash
   sudo mv apache-jmeter-5.6.3 /opt/jmeter
   ```

---

### 🚀 Step 3: Launch JMeter GUI

Run JMeter using the terminal:

```bash
/opt/jmeter/bin/jmeter
```

This will open the JMeter GUI.

---

### 🧪 Step 4: Create Your First Test Plan

1. **Open JMeter GUI**.

2. **Right-click on Test Plan → Add → Threads → Thread Group**

   * Set number of users (threads), ramp-up time, and loop count.

3. **Add HTTP Request Sampler**:

   * Right-click on Thread Group → Add → Sampler → HTTP Request
   * Set:

     * **Server Name or IP**: `dashboard.sm.test.cwdin.com`
     * **Protocol**: `https`
     * **Path**: `/home/entity-management/devices`
     * **Method**: `GET` or `POST` as required

4. **Add Listener to View Results**:

   * Right-click on Thread Group → Add → Listener → View Results in Table / Summary Report / Graph Results

---

### 🔒 Step 5: Add Authorization (if login is required)

If your website requires login:

* Use **HTTP Cookie Manager** to maintain session.
* Add a **Login HTTP Request** before your actual test steps (POST request with username/password).
* Use **HTTP Header Manager** to pass headers (e.g., Authorization tokens or CSRF tokens).

---

### 📊 Step 6: Run the Test

Click the green **Start** button in JMeter. You’ll see results in the listener(s) you added.

---

### 📈 Step 7: Analyze Results

Key metrics to look for:

* **Response Time**: How long requests take
* **Throughput**: Requests per second
* **Error %**: How many failed
* **Latency**: Time to first byte

---

### 📦 Optional: CLI (Headless) Mode for Larger Loads

To run JMeter in terminal without GUI:

```bash
/opt/jmeter/bin/jmeter -n -t your_test_plan.jmx -l result.csv -e -o report_folder
```

This will generate an HTML report inside `report_folder`.

---

### 🔁 Step 8: Iterate and Scale

* Start small (5-10 users), then scale up gradually (50, 100, 500, etc.).
* Test different scenarios: login, search, data load, message send, etc.
* Identify bottlenecks (slow APIs, memory issues, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Optional Tools to Integrate

| Tool               | Use Case                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Grafana + InfluxDB | Live monitoring during JMeter test           |
| BlazeMeter         | Cloud-based JMeter testing                   |
| Gatling            | Alternative performance testing tool (Scala) |
| Locust             | Python-based load testing tool               |

---

## ✅ Summary Checklist

* [x] Java installed
* [x] JMeter installed and launched
* [x] Test plan created (Thread Group + HTTP Requests)
* [x] Listeners added for result analysis
* [x] Login/authentication handled
* [x] CLI tests and reports generated
* [x] Results analyzed for bottlenecks

---

If you'd like, I can help you build a `.jmx` test plan specifically for your login + device management flow, or even generate a CLI-ready command for automated testing.

Would you like to proceed with a login + navigation flow test or stress test just the `/devices` endpoint?




Great question! You're thinking like a real performance tester now 👏

Let’s **add a bit of complexity** to your JMeter test plan so that it **actually tests performance under load**, not just sends one request.

We’ll do this step-by-step:

---

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn in This Step

* Simulate **multiple users hitting your website at once**
* Measure response time, throughput, and failure rate
* Know if your website is **slow**, **struggling**, or **performing well**

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step: Make Your Test Plan More “Performance-Oriented”

---

### ✅ Step 1: Increase the Number of Users

Go to your **Thread Group** (click on it in the left panel) and update:

| Setting                       | Value |
| ----------------------------- | ----- |
| **Number of Threads (Users)** | `50`  |
| **Ramp-Up Period (Seconds)**  | `10`  |
| **Loop Count**                | `2`   |

🧠 Explanation:

* 50 virtual users will be created.
* They’ll start over 10 seconds (not all at once).
* Each will hit the endpoint **2 times**, for a total of 100 requests.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Add Timers (Simulate real user delay)

Right-click on `Thread Group` → `Add` → `Timer` → `Constant Timer`

Set **Thread Delay (in milliseconds)**: `500` (half a second)

This means: wait 500ms between requests (simulating real human browsing behavior).

---

### ✅ Step 3: Add a Summary Report to See Performance

You probably already added this, but if not:

Right-click on `Thread Group` → `Add` → `Listener` → `Summary Report`

This shows:

* **Samples** = Number of requests sent
* **Average** = Avg response time in milliseconds
* **Min/Max** = Fastest/slowest request
* **Error %** = Failure rate
* **Throughput** = Requests per second

---

### ✅ Step 4: Run the Test Again

Click the **Green Start Button** (▶️) again.

* Go to **Summary Report** or **View Results in Table**
* You’ll now see **multiple requests**, and you’ll be able to measure:

  * If response times increase
  * If the server starts returning errors (e.g., 500)
  * If throughput stays stable

---

### 📊 How Do You Know if It’s Testing Performance?

You’ll **know it’s a real performance test** when:

✅ You see:

* More than 1 request
* Response times being logged (especially under higher users)
* Server errors (if site can’t handle load)

✅ You analyze:

* If response times rise when threads increase
* If error % goes above 0 (e.g., server fails to respond)
* If throughput drops under higher user loads

---

### 🔥 Optional: Try with 100 Users

Change:

* Threads = 100
* Ramp-Up = 20 seconds

Run it again and **see how your server behaves** under pressure.

---

Would you like me to help next with:

* **Adding login (authentication)** before testing protected URLs?
* **Exporting an HTML performance report**?
* **Running this from terminal in headless mode for large tests?**

Let me know and I’ll walk you through!
Awesome! 🚀 You're now running a **real performance test**, and your results clearly show:

* ✅ 100 requests completed
* ✅ All had **"Success"**
* ✅ You're measuring **latency, response time**, and **throughput**

Let me explain **how to read and analyze** what you just did.

---

## 🧠 How to Understand These JMeter Results

Each row shows **one HTTP request** sent by a virtual user.

### 🔍 Important Columns:

| Column            | Meaning                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Thread Name**   | Which virtual user (`Thread Group 1-X`) sent the request |
| **Sample Time**   | Time taken to complete the request                       |
| **Response Code** | `Success` means HTTP 200 (OK)                            |
| **Latency**       | Time to receive the first byte                           |
| **Connect**       | Time taken to establish TCP connection                   |
| **Response Time** | Total time to get a response from the server             |

---

## 📈 Is This Really Testing Performance?

YES. You just tested:

* How your server performs under **simulated 50 users × 2 loops = 100 requests**
* Response time ranges from:

  * As high as **5,000ms** (5 seconds)
  * To as low as **6–30ms**

This shows:

* Your server handles traffic but with **variable response times**
* Some responses were **slow** (indicates potential bottlenecks)

---

## ✅ What You Can Do Next (Slightly More Advanced)

Here are **next steps** to go deeper — pick whichever you want, and I’ll guide you:

### 1. 🧾 Generate HTML Report with Graphs

* So you can share the results with your team visually.

### 2. 🔐 Add Login Step Before Accessing `/devices`

* Simulate real user login with username/password (POST request)
* Carry session cookies and test authenticated pages

### 3. 📊 Add Graphs: View Real-Time Graph Results

* Add: Listener → Graph Results / Response Time Graph

### 4. 🧪 Increase Load to 200–500 Users

* Stress test the server and find the **breaking point**

### 5. ⚙️ Run in CLI mode (terminal) and export results

* Great for scheduled or headless testing

---

## 📌 Final Tip: Know When Your Website Is Struggling

**Signs of performance issues:**

* Response times consistently > 3000ms
* High error percentage
* Throughput dropping when users increase

---

Let me know which one you want to try next — for example:

> "I want to add login step before accessing the devices page."

Or:

> "Help me export an HTML report."

Perfect, thank you!

Your login URL is:
🔐 `https://dashboard.sm.test.cwdin.com/login`
But under the hood (in browser DevTools), it's likely making a **POST request** to something like `/auth/login`.

Let’s confirm and implement that now.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Identify Login Request Type

Please do the following in your browser:

### 🕵️‍♂️ Use DevTools to Inspect Login Call

1. Open [https://dashboard.sm.test.cwdin.com/login](https://dashboard.sm.test.cwdin.com/login)
2. Open **Developer Tools** (Right click → Inspect → Go to `Network` tab)
3. Login with test credentials
4. Look for the first **XHR / Fetch** request — you’ll likely see `/auth/login` or similar.
5. Click it and check:

   * **Request URL**
   * **Request Method** (POST or GET)
   * **Request Payload / Form Data** (e.g., `username=email@example.com`, `password=xyz123`)
   * **Request Headers** (Especially `Content-Type`, `Authorization`, `X-CSRF-TOKEN`, etc.)

Please **share** the following:

* ✅ Final login request **URL**
* ✅ Whether it sends **form data** or **raw JSON**
* ✅ Required headers like CSRF tokens or bearer tokens, if any

---

Once you confirm those details, I will:

* Set up the login request **exactly**
* Configure the HTTP Header and Body (JSON or Form)
* Ensure session/cookie is maintained to access `/home/entity-management/devices`

⚠️ *Without these details, JMeter might try to log in incorrectly (wrong headers/body).*
Once I have them, we’ll move to Step 2: **Add Graphs** and Step 3: **HTML Report**.

Would you like help checking this in DevTools?

I’ll guide you line-by-line.
Perfect — this is exactly what we needed! 🔍

You found the **correct login endpoint**:

### ✅ Login Endpoint:

```
POST https://web.sm.test.cwdin.com/api/v1/user/auth/login
```

Now, let’s fix your JMeter login request — because right now you're getting a `314 Warning`, which means **JMeter is not sending the request in the correct format** (likely missing headers or wrong body format).

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Setup Correct Login in JMeter

---

### 🔧 1. Update Login HTTP Request

1. In your Test Plan, click on `Login Request`.

2. Change these fields:

| Field           | Value                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Method**      | `POST`                    |
| **Protocol**    | `https`                   |
| **Server Name** | `web.sm.test.cwdin.com`   |
| **Path**        | `/api/v1/user/auth/login` |

---

### 🧾 2. Add Body Data (Raw JSON)

Click on **Login Request → Body Data** tab:

Paste the following (replace with real credentials):

```json
{
  "username": "your_username_here",
  "password": "your_password_here"
}
```

---

### 🧠 3. Add Header Manager

You must tell the server that you're sending JSON.

1. Right-click on `Login Request` → `Add` → `Config Element` → `HTTP Header Manager`

2. Click **Add** → Set:

| Name         | Value              |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| Content-Type | `application/json` |
| Accept       | `application/json` |

---

### 🍪 4. Add HTTP Cookie Manager

To manage the session:

* Right-click `Test Plan` → `Add` → `Config Element` → `HTTP Cookie Manager`

✅ Make sure this is added **only once** to your Test Plan.

---

### ✅ 5. Test the Login

Now run the test:

* If login works, you’ll see `200 OK` or `201 Created`
* If you still see `314` or other error, we’ll debug by:

  * Adding `View Results Tree`
  * Looking at **Request Data** and **Response Data** to see the error message

---

### 🧪 6. Make Sure Device Page Runs After Login

Move the **"Open Devices Page" request** **after** login.
(Or just confirm that it’s already after it in the tree view.)

Now, JMeter will:

1. Log in
2. Use that session to load `/devices`

---

## ✅ Next Steps

If you're ready, we can now proceed to:

### 🔄 Step 2: Add Graphs and Response Time Visuals

→ Great for spotting performance slowdowns in real-time

### 📊 Step 3: Generate Beautiful HTML Report

→ Gives your team a clean dashboard of performance

### 🔥 Step 4: Increase to 100–500 Users (Stress Test)

### ⚙️ Step 5: Run from Terminal (Headless) with CSV/HTML Output

---

Would you like to move to **graphs** or first confirm that login is working with 200/201?
If login is still showing 314, we can debug it right away.

Thanks for sharing the error log — this is **very clear**:

---

## ❌ Problem:

```
Cannot write to '/home/cwd/jmeter_results/html_report' as folder does not exist and parent folder is not writable
```

This means:

* Either the `/home/cwd/jmeter_results` folder **doesn’t exist**
* Or your user doesn't have **write permission** there

---

## ✅ Solution: Create Folder with Correct Permissions

### Step 1: Manually create the results folder

In your terminal, run:

```bash
mkdir -p /home/cwd/jmeter_results/html_report
```

Then set permissions to allow writing:

```bash
chmod -R 755 /home/cwd/jmeter_results
```

---

### Step 2: Re-run JMeter from CLI

Now run the same command again:

```bash
/opt/jmeter/bin/jmeter \
  -n \
  -t /home/cwd/Downloads/Performancss/performance_test_plan.jmx \
  -l /home/cwd/jmeter_results/result.jtl \
  -e \
  -o /home/cwd/jmeter_results/html_report
```

---

### Step 3: Open HTML Report

Once JMeter finishes running, open it:

```bash
xdg-open /home/cwd/jmeter_results/html_report/index.html
```

---

## 🎉 You’re Set!

Once this works, you'll get a full performance dashboard in browser.

Ready for next step?
We can now do:

* 🔥 **Stress test** (100–500 users)
* 🧪 Add **Assertions** (fail if response time > X or status ≠ 200)
* ⚙️ Create a reusable **bash script** for CI/CD automation

Let me know which you'd like!
Perfect! 👌 You saved your JMeter test plan at:

```
/home/cwd/Downloads/Performancss/performance_test_plan.jmx
```

Let’s now generate the full HTML report using that file.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step to Generate HTML Report (with your file path)

### 🔧 Step 1: Open Your Terminal and Run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/jmeter_results
```

This creates a folder to store results and the HTML report.

---

### 🖥️ Step 2: Run JMeter in CLI to Generate Report

Now run this command:

```bash
/opt/jmeter/bin/jmeter \
  -n \
  -t /home/cwd/Downloads/Performancss/performance_test_plan.jmx \
  -l ~/jmeter_results/result.jtl \
  -e \
  -o ~/jmeter_results/html_report
```

> ⚠️ Make sure `/opt/jmeter/bin/jmeter` is correct.
> If not, try `which jmeter` or just type `jmeter` if it's in your PATH.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Open the HTML Report

Once the command completes, run this to view the report in your browser:

```bash
xdg-open ~/jmeter_results/html_report/index.html
```

Or manually open the file:

```
~/jmeter_results/html_report/index.html
```

## 🎯 Next Step?

Would you like to now:

1. 🔥 Increase to **500 users** and simulate a stress test?
2. 🛠️ Schedule/automate tests via a **Bash script**?
3. 🧪 Add assertions (like response must be < 5s or status = 200)?
4. 🧼 Clean up old results and automate HTML reports generation?

Let me know what you'd like to do next — you're doing amazing so far!
Great! 🧾 Let’s generate a **professional HTML report** from your JMeter test results.

---

## ✅ Step 3: Generate an HTML Report in JMeter

We’ll do this using the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** — even if you use GUI to create the test plan, **report generation must be done in CLI** for HTML.

---

### 🔧 Step 1: Save Your `.jmx` Test Plan

In the GUI:

* File → Save Test Plan As → `performance_test_plan.jmx`
* Example path: `/home/yourusername/Desktop/performance_test_plan.jmx`

---

### 📁 Step 2: Create a Folder for Test Results

Open terminal and run:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/jmeter_results
```

This folder will hold:

* `.jtl` result file (raw data)
* Final HTML report

---

### 🖥️ Step 3: Run JMeter Test from CLI

In your terminal, run this (update paths as needed):

```bash
/opt/jmeter/bin/jmeter \
  -n \
  -t /home/yourusername/Desktop/performance_test_plan.jmx \
  -l ~/jmeter_results/result.jtl \
  -e \
  -o ~/jmeter_results/html_report
```

### 📌 What Each Flag Means:

| Flag | Meaning                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------- |
| `-n` | Non-GUI (headless mode)       |
| `-t` | Path to your `.jmx` test plan |
| `-l` | Path to `.jtl` results file   |
| `-e` | Generate report               |
| `-o` | Output folder for HTML report |

---

### ✅ Step 4: View the HTML Report

Once it finishes, open your report in browser:

```bash
xdg-open ~/jmeter_results/html_report/index.html
```

You’ll see:

* 📈 Response time graph
* 🕓 Time vs load
* 🔥 Errors (if any)
* 💡 Insights like 95th percentile response time, throughput, etc.

---

## ✅ Want to Go Next?

We can now:

### 🔥 Step 4: Simulate 100–500 Users (Load Test)

* Increase thread count & ramp-up
* Monitor server performance under pressure

### ⚙️ Step 5: Automate CLI-based Test in a Script (for daily runs)

Let me know which step you’d like next, or if you want to review or share your current HTML report.
Awesome! Since your login and authenticated device page are now set up ✅, let’s move to the **next step**:

---

## 📊 Step 2: Add Real-Time Graphs and Visualize Performance

These graphs will show you:

* 📈 Response time trends
* 🔁 Request throughput
* ❌ Failures if any
* ⚖️ Server performance under load

---

### ✅ Add Graph Listeners in JMeter GUI

> 📌 **Add these to your Thread Group**, NOT under individual requests.

#### 1. **Graph Results (Simple)**

* Right-click on `Thread Group` → `Add` → `Listener` → `Graph Results`

#### 2. **Response Time Graph**

* Right-click on `Thread Group` → `Add` → `Listener` → `Response Time Graph`

#### 3. **Aggregate Report**

* Right-click on `Thread Group` → `Add` → `Listener` → `Aggregate Report`
* This will show:

  * Min, Max, Avg response time
  * Standard deviation
  * Throughput (req/sec)

#### 4. (Optional) **View Results Tree**

* Use only during testing (it slows things down under large loads)
* Right-click on `Thread Group` → `Add` → `Listener` → `View Results Tree`

---

### ▶️ Run the Test

1. Click the **green "Start" button**.
2. While test runs:

   * Watch **Graph Results** and **Response Time Graph**
   * You’ll see response spikes, delays, or failures if they occur

---

### 🧠 How to Interpret the Graphs:

| Graph                      | What to Look For                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📈 **Graph Results**       | Line color thickness = how many samples                   |
| 📉 **Response Time Graph** | Spikes = delays or server bottlenecks                     |
| 📋 **Aggregate Report**    | Avg response > 3000 ms = possible slowness                |
| 🚨 **Errors**              | Look at %Error in Aggregate Report or red lines in Graphs |

---

## ✅ Summary So Far:

You’ve now completed:

✔️ Simulated login + authenticated access
✔️ Added graphs for real-time feedback
✔️ Able to monitor response time + performance

---

### ✅ Next Step: Want to Generate a Clean HTML Report?

This report is **beautiful, shareable, and includes all graphs + tables**.

👉 Shall we proceed to **Step 3: HTML Report Generation** using the CLI?
Awesome! Since you're ready — let's now **stress test your site with higher load** to evaluate how it behaves under pressure.

---

## 🔥 Step 4: Simulate a Stress Test (100–500 Users)

This helps you find:

* Server limits 🧱
* Bottlenecks 🐢
* Response time spikes 📈
* Failures at scale ❌

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step: Update Thread Group Settings

1. **Open your test plan** in JMeter GUI:
   `performance_test_plan.jmx`

2. Click on **Thread Group** (first element in your test plan)

3. Change these values:

| Field                         | Value | Description                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Number of Threads (Users)** | `500` | Simulates 500 users                   |
| **Ramp-Up Period (seconds)**  | `60`  | Gradually start all users over 60 sec |
| **Loop Count**                | `1`   | Each user runs test once              |

> ⚠️ **Start lower (e.g., 100)** and go up in steps — don't go straight to 1000 unless your server can handle it.

---

### 🧪 Optional: Add Assertions (Recommended)

To **fail** test cases automatically if something goes wrong:

#### Add Response Assertion:

1. Right-click on **"Open Devices Page"** → `Add` → `Assertions` → `Response Assertion`
2. In **Response Field to Test**: Choose `Text Response`
3. In **Pattern Matching Rules**: Choose `Contains`
4. Add a **pattern** like:

   ```
   "Devices"
   ```

   *(Or some text that only appears on successful pages)*

You can also assert:

* HTTP Response Code = 200
* Response Time < 5000 ms

---

### 💾 Save the Plan

Save after these changes:
`File → Save`

---

### ▶️ Step 5: Run from CLI Again

Run with the updated load test settings:

```bash
/opt/jmeter/bin/jmeter \
  -n \
  -t /home/cwd/Downloads/Performancss/performance_test_plan.jmx \
  -l /home/cwd/jmeter_results/result_high_load.jtl \
  -e \
  -o /home/cwd/jmeter_results/html_report_high_load
```

Then open the report:

```bash
xdg-open /home/cwd/jmeter_results/html_report_high_load/index.html
```

---

## ✅ What to Look For in the HTML Report:

| Metric             | Good Value  | Signs of Trouble        |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Avg. Response Time | < 1000 ms   | > 3000 ms               |
| Error %            | 0%          | > 1%                    |
| Throughput         | High = Good | Drops = server overload |
| 95% Line           | < 1500 ms   | Higher = latency        |

---

### ✅ Next Step?

You're now stress testing like a pro! We can now:

1. 🛠️ Automate everything using a **Bash script**
2. 📥 Export test results to Excel/CSV
